First, functions called processes are run, which take the current time step as an argument. These may query state, and queue state updates or schedule events, but cannot update state. Next (if being used) events are processed, meaning any event whose delay is currently 0 is \"fired\", and a set of associated functions called event listeners is called for the set of persons experiencing that event. Much like processes, event listeners can queue state updates and schedule future events. Next, the delay on all events is decremented by one. Finally, all queued state updates are applied.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Individual.jl","title":"Individual.jl","text":"The simulation loop ensures that models in Individual.jl follow a synchronous updating scheme (i.e. all state is updated simultaneously at the end of a time step).","category":"page"},{"location":"#Alternatives","page":"Individual.jl","title":"Alternatives","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Individual.jl","title":"Individual.jl","text":"Another framework for individual based modeling in Julia is Agents.jl.
